This directory is for training monolingual BERT that was pretrained on Arabic
text and community-submitted to HuggingFace. The official documentation for the

We will fine tune this model on the task of tweet sentiment classification once
using a small annotated dataset of Arabic tweets and then augmenting this
dataset with english-to-arabic machine translated annotated tweets.
