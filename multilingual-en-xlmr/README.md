This directory contains code for fine-tuning two multi-lingual XLM-R models. The first fine-tuned on Eenglish tweets and the second fine-tuned on a combination of English and Arabic tweets.

Both models are compared on their ability to correctly classify Arabic tweets, and their accuracy scores are reported.
